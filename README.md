# AngularJS Data Binding using a Service

An application that allows users to keep a record of their favorite movies. The application allows them to input information and store the information in an array that is displayed on a different section of the application.

## Base Mode:

For this application, you will need two views, two controllers, and one factory:

The first view will be a series of inputs and a button. The inputs should include the movie name, a short description of the movie, the director, and how long the movie is.

The controller for the first view should have a button that 'grabs' the information off of the form and stores it inside of a factory for the second view.

The second view should display all of the movies using a ng-repeat.

The second controller should grab all of the movies from the factory and make them available to the view.

## Hard Mode:

Style the whole experience with Bootstrap!

## Pro Mode:

Have a break down the middle for the two views. So rather than have the experience stacked top and bottom, have them side by side.
